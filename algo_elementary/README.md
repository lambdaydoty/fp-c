## C Array

* If the *index* is **known**, any item can be accessed in constant time.
* The size of an array is fixed and must be **known** before they are used.
* Arrays are fundamental data structures in that they have a direct correspondence with memory systems. (*memory address* <-> *array index*)
* Mathematically 1D arrays <-> *vectors*; 2D arrays <-> *matrices*
